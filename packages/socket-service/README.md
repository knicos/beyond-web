# Socket Service

Provides a single websocket endpoint at `/v1/socket`. Authentication is done either by having an appropriate session cookie with an access token (obtained from the auth-service, for example the browser does this), or by using HTTP basic authenication and OAuth2 client credentials in the HTTP Authorization header upon making the websocket connection. An OAuth2 bearer token can also be used.

The websocket endpoint then follows the FTL protocol requirements. It uses MsgPack for RPC calls.
